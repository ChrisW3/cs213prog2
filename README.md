OK GUYS LETS DO SOME CODING
LETS SHOW ME MY MOVES

^^ fuck that stupid moron

Ok so I popped off a bit and it works for all the test cases given, just need to do the remove function in tuitionManager which is just calling it from the Student cs213 object. I didn't do any documentation or test beds for any of the subclasses yet. So what we left is:

  - testbeds for subclasses
  - Class diagram
  - remove method in TuitionManager
  - a lot of the print errors given in project desc aren't defined either
  - Our personal time logs
  
Should be easy from here, I'm gunna sleep in a bit cuz its late af, do what ya can :)
